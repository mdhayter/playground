Created repo on github
- initialize with README

Use Git Clone menu command to get to dev editor
- Needed to set local base directory

Created this file and started putting text in it.

Right click on it and Git Add

Right click on project and Push to Origin
- Needed to login
- checked on github, changes are indeed there

Ok, so how do I get a template project in here? Maybe that is Import?

Create a new project SimpleJS as Javascript Chrome App (wonder why there is not
a Polymer option?)

Import folder into playground. It is a subfolder. If highlighted I get the play
option and it seems to run when I play.

Removed SimpleJS project and deleted it.

Had to move things to toplevel of playground to work
